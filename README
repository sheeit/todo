todo
====

This program is still very much a work in progress (it doesn't even do
anything as of now), but once finished, it'll allow me to add notes or
reminders for myself for things that I should do.
It'll go somehow like this:

```
$ ./todo -a 'Do this thing that you hav to do.'
```
to add a new entry to your todo; or

```
$ ./todo -l
```
to list all your undone things that you should be doing, or

```
$ ./todo -l all
```
to list all your things to do including things you've already done, or

```
$ ./todo -l 4
```
to list information about the entry number 4 on your todo list, or

```
$ ./todo -d 4
```
to mark the fourth entry as done, or

```
$ ./todo -v
```
to show:

There's still a lot of work to do, and nothing is implemented yet, so
suggestions are welcome!
